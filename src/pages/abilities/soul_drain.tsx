    "Effects": "Target a creature within range. They must make a Constitution saving throw or take 3d6 necrotic damage, with the caster healing for half the damage dealt. On a successful save, the target takes half damage and the caster doesn't heal. Undead and constructs are immune to this spell.",
    
    "Enhanced Casting": "When cast using the Staff of Whispers, the spell's range increases to 60 feet and the caster heals for the full amount of damage dealt. Additionally, the caster gains temporary hit points equal to their spellcasting modifier."
